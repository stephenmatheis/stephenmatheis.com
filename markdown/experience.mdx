My name is **Stephen Matheis**. I've been a professional **software engineer** for 11 years. I write websites and applications in **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. When I can, I choose **TypeScript** and **SCSS**. I use **Node.js** on the backend. I build frontends with **React**. I know **Next.js** and **Vite**. I host on **AWS**. I store data in **MongoDB**. I create designs with **Figma**.

From April 2024 to May 2025, I worked at TATCS remotely as the Director of User Experience. I lead our UI/UX work for our clients and internal projects.

From October 2023 to March 2024, I worked at TATCS remotely as Senior Application Solutions Engineer. I designed, developed, and deployed a new tsunami.gov. Next.js on the front. AWS and Node.js for the backend. Everything is stored MongoDB.

From August 2022 to October 2023, I worked at Apple as a Front-end Developer. I prototyped a new Apple Watch Series 9 buy flow. I created a React component and Next.js page and route scaffolding tool for rapid prototyping. Our team lead got to present it an annual internal dev forum. I think it's still used today. It's nothing special. I borrowed a lot of ideas from IDEs and yeoman. But I'm proud of it. Shortening the feedback loop from **_this briefs well on paper_** to the always possible and often likely **_that was a bust_** allowed us to experiment more an ship good stuff faster.

From May 2022 to July 2022, I joined GovCIO as a Software Engineer where I got to work on a project for the Air Force. We were building a 3D tactical data link (TDL) platform to replace an aging system running on obsolete hardware. I was only on the team for a short time because I got the chance to work at Apple.

From May 2021 to April 2022, I worked at Aeyon as a Senior Software Engineer. I built several internal applications for the Defense Health Agency using an all Microsoft stack: .NET, ASP, SQL Server, and IIS. I also wrote and maintained a dozen or so client-side SharePoint apps with jQuery, Bootstrap, DataTables, and Chart.js. For the last couple of months I designed and developed a mobile app for the U.S. Marine Corps. It's a training and reference app for finance personnel since a new system was coming online.
