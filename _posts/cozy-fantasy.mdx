After finishing Travis Baldree's amazing novel [Legends & Lattes](https://www.travisbaldree.com/books), I quickly stumbled upon the excellent [r/CozyFantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyFantasy/) while searching for similar stories.

Here's what I've read so far:

-   [The Cybernetic Tea Shop](https://www.softcryptid.com/meredith-books/the-cybernetic-tea-shop/) by Meredith Katz<Sup>1</Sup>
-   [The Tomes & Tea Series](http://rebeccathorne.net/cozy-fantasy/) by Rebecca Thorne<Sup>2</Sup>

These stories were uniquley wonderful but still felt pleasantly familiar and, of course, were very cozy.

So, why cozy fantasy? What's the appeal? I used to read a lot as a kid and teen. Come adulthood, I made less time to get lost in a great books. A few years ago, I burned out at work. Like, fried. Cripsy. Done. I'm still figuring things out, but I've slowly started getting back into what used to bring joy. Unfortunatley, I still don't read as much as I used to. And when I do, I usually reach for the same few stories.

I love fantasy settings. The (usually rather large, at least in my my experience) cast of characters, rich world buidling, magic systems, politics, etc. Robert Jordan's The Wheel Of Time series is a classic that checks most boxes. But it's, uh, not an easy story to just pick up here and there. Every couple of years, I try to get back into it. I usualy crap out by book 5 or so before life intervenes.

But, as I get older, I find that I just don't care for darker stories. I never really liked them, to be honest. But my tolerance has shrunk over the years. When I want to relax and sink into a good story it's usually to decompress after a stressful day. Having lived for a few decades means there are memories I'd rather not revist. Some stories just hit harder than I'm comfortable with. I find it tough to enjoy new media when warned about scenes i'd just rather not experience.

I realize that drama - especially conflict - is kinda the point of most stories. I totally get that _slice of life_ stories aren't that exciting for most people. But for silly ol me I just can't get enough of them. It's my favorite genre of Anime. Especially slower paced isekais about overworked souls finding solice in fantasy worlds through the use of increasingly ridiculous application of their unique OP abilties.

How to use the word crommulent?

I'm just now learning there are other ways to enjoy these types of stories. Manga, light novels, and something called [LitRPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LitRPG). Fan-translated light novels are a great resource, and I applaud the communities efforts. I hope they don't mind my saying that, given a choice, I'd prefer to read stories with a bit more polish. I love that this story telling style is becoming more popular in America.

I'll leave you with [r/CozyFantasy's list of recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyFantasy/wiki/recommendationguide/), helpfully grouped by subgenre.

        I really enjoyed this one. It's short, but incredibly well told.

        This is a quartet! The first and second books _Can't Spell Treason without Tea_, and _A Pirates Life for Tea_, are already out. Books two
        and three don't have titles yet.
