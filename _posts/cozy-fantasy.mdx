After finishing Travis Baldree's amazing novel [Legends & Lattes](https://www.travisbaldree.com/books), I quickly stumbled upon the excellent [r/CozyFantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyFantasy/) while searching for similar stories.

Here's what I've read so far:

-   [The Cybernetic Tea Shop](https://www.softcryptid.com/meredith-books/the-cybernetic-tea-shop/) by Meredith Katz<Sup>1</Sup>
-   [The Tomes & Tea Series](http://rebeccathorne.net/cozy-fantasy/) by Rebecca Thorne<Sup>2</Sup>

These stories were uniquely wonderful but still felt pleasantly familiar and, of course, were very cozy.

I encourage you to check out [r/CozyFantasy's list of recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyFantasy/wiki/recommendationguide/), helpfully grouped by subgenre.

        I really enjoyed this one. It's short and sweet.

    <Note>
        This series is a quartet! The first and second books _Can't Spell Treason without Tea_, and _A Pirates Life for Tea_, are already out. Books two and three don't have titles or release dates yet.
