This site runs on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) because it's what I use at work. Blog posts are written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) because markdown and JSX.

[Check out the repo](https://github.com/stephenmatheis/stephenmatheis.com/blob/main/components/body/body.tsx) if you'd like to learn more.
