I don’t know if I have it in me to write a whole novel. I’m jealous of people who produce a lot. Who can write or make or draw a lot of stuff consistently over time. I mean I’m happy for them! I truly am. But I’m also envious. I wish I had the stamina or drive or whatever I think I’m missing to produce that much GOOD stuff. It’s not enough to just draw or write or make. It has to be worth it.

Worth it. Who decides if it’s worth it?
