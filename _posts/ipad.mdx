I love iPad. I've had the 12.9 inch version since 2020. Before that I had the 10.5 inch iPad Pro and before that iPad Air.

It’s not perfect. It’s heavier than I'd like. And the Magic Keyboard only makes it heavier. It’s got a smaller screen than the MacBook Air 13. But it’s also the only Apple product this large that you can draw and write on.

I think this is a hot take: I prefer iPad OS' window management. [NEEDS MORE EXPLANATION]

I just wish I could run VS Code on the iPad. I get that it’s hard to make things do things they weren’t designed to do. Saying “the iPad was clearly designed to do ex why and zee” implies I was there when the iPad was designed which is not the case.
