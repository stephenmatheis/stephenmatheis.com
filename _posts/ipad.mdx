I love my new iPad. It’s amazing. It’s not perfect. It’s heavy. And the Magic Keyboard only makes it heavier. It’s got a smaller screen than the MacBook Air 13. But it’s also the only Apple product this large that you can draw and write on. And window management makes more sense on it. I never liked the way desktop environments (DE) worked. I like the way the iPad and iPhone work. I just wish I could run VS Code on the iPad. I get that it’s hard to make things do things they weren’t designed to do. Saying “the iPad was clearly designed to do ex why and zee” implies I was there when the iPad was designed which is not the case.
