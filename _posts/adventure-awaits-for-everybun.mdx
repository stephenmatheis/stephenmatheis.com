I don't know about you, but if you're anything like me, you probably forget that life is for the living.

I have panic attacks. They suck. Literally. They suck all the life out of...life. They make everyday sharp and terrifying. I hate them. I don't hate a lot of things. Actually, I hate to hate things. Even that's not quite right. Because I don't want to hate anything. Hate is such a strong word. Not that there’s anything wrong with strong words. I just don’t…this is getting away from me.

What I want to say I hope joy comes knocking soon and sweeps you off into a grand adventure. With airships. Because airships rule.
