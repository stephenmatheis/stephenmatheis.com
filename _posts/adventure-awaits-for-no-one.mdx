I don't know about you, but if you're anything like me you probably forget that life is for the living.

I'm here to remind you - and, well, me - that it most certainly is! I'm prone to panic attacks. They suck. Literally. They suck all the life out of...life. They make everyday sharp and terrifying. I hate them. I don't hate a lot of things. Actually, I hate to hate things. Even that's not quite right. Because I'd hate to hate things I hate. Hate is such a strong word. Not that there’s anything wrong with strong words. I just don’t…this is getting away from me.

What I want to say is bullies suck. Even word bullies.

I can also bully myself into thinking that I don't deserve to live life. Do you ever feel that way? If you do I'm very sorry. I hope joy comes knocking soon and sweeps you off into a grand advenure. With airships. Becuase airships rule.
