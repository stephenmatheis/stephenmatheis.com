I test drove a Tesla Model Y Long Range last week. I bought one that day.

To be fair, my spouse and I were looking for a new vehicle. Our last new cars where a 2016 Ford Escape and 2015 Ford Fiesta ST. We leased each for three years. In 2018 we started paying down debt so we turned in the leases and bought a 2007 Corolla from my spouse's parents for $1,200 cash. Last year we bought their 2006 Honda S2000 (they weren't driving it much anymore and we wanted to keep it in the family) for $15,000 at $250 per month. It's in amazing mechanical condition. All stock. We just recently had to replace the top. But it's been a remarkably easy car to maintain. We love taking it out in the Texas hill country to grab lunch or a pint.

We've enjoyed not having a car payment. But it was time to upgrade. The Corolla's been great to us. We're grateful that it's lasted as long as it has. The S2000 always puts a smile on our faces, but it's not a daily driver.

I thought I wanted a Hyundai Santa Cruz. I always loved the Subaru Baja. I wish utes were more a thing in the States. Alas. Bottom line: it was fun-ish to drive. Peppy. Interior was meh. With dealer markups the cheapest we could get one with adaptive cruise control was the limited trim for $48,000. Ooph.

My spouse has wanted one of the new Broncos for years. We test drove the Sport model a few weeks. Verdict: too big. The Heritage looks dope but it's like $60,000. I wish I could buy them one 

We're moving to D.C. in a few weeks. We wanted our next car to be big enough for IKEA runs, gardening stuff, medium-ish trips and light camping. But small enough for city streets.
