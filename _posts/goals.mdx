Goals, at least to me, are weird. I don't think I'm an ambitious person. I don't have any aspirations as far as I'm aware. Success is weird to me, too. Sure, I'd love a bunch of money. But I'd just use it to make myself and the people I know and like more comfortable. I don't follow causes. I'm not an activist. I don't want to _be_ anything.

I struggle with this. There are people who describe themselves as _Goals oriented_. I think it's odd that society generally approves of having goals and disapproves of not having them. This balanced proportonal where one side of an issue is encouraged and it's inverse is equally frowned up is commmon. It's good to eat well, and it's bad to eat poorly. It's good to move around a bit every once and while, and it's bad to lounge for too long.
