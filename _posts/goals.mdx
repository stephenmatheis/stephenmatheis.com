Goals, to me, are weird. So is success. I don't have any big aspirations. I don't follow causes. I don't want to _be_ anything.

I struggle with this. There are people who describe themselves as _Goals oriented_. I think it's odd that society generally approves of having goals and disapproves of not having them. This balanced proportonal where one side of an issue is encouraged and it's inverse is equally frowned up is commmon. It's good to eat well, and it's bad to eat poorly. It's good to move around a bit every once and while, and it's bad to lounge for too long.
