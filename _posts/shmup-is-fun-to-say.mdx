For the past few days I've been working through [Lazy Game Dev's](https://www.youtube.com/@LazyDevs) [SHMUP series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLea8cjCua_P3Sfq4XJqNVbd1vsWnh7LZd).

Porting [older React apps](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component) to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) pays the bills. But the past few days working with [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) has recharged the batteries.
