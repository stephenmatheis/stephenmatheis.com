This site runs on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). Blog posts are written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). I chose [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) over the [default option](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/mdx) for three reasons:

1. You can store posts outside of the `app` directory. This allowed me create the feed of the twenty most recent 20 posts on the root route. Of course, you can still create separate routes for each post.
2. It supports [front matter](https://frontmatter.codes/docs/markdown) and [rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype) and [remark](https://remark.js.org/) plugins.
3. If I ever needed to, I could pull in posts from an [external source](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote#examples) like a remote database using [server side fetch](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating#fetching-data-on-the-server-with-fetch).

Check out the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/stephenmatheis/stephenmatheis.com/blob/main/components/body/body.tsx). Feedback welcome.
