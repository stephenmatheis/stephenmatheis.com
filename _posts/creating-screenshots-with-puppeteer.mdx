I've used [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com) to save bookmarks for, I don't know, like at least 10 years. I rarely go back to look at the links I saved. I just hoard them. I do it mostly to feel better about closing tabs. Just in case I ever want to revisit them.

I recently did want to look up a site. But I could only remember what it looked it. Instapaper, unsurprisingly, only lists the title, description, address, and favicon of the items you save. I didn't want to go through the list loading each one at a time to find what I was looking for.

The first idea seemed promising. I exported everything I had saved as a CSV. Then I used [INSERT CLI TOOL]() to convert it to JSON, which I modified slighly to instead export a JS object so it could be imported directly.
