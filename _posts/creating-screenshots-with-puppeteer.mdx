I use [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com) to save bookmarks. I rarely go back to look at them. I mostly just want to feel safe closing tabs.

But recently I did want to look something up. I could only remember what it looked like though. Instapaper, unsurprisingly, only displays title, description, address, and favicon. I really didn't want to load them one at a time. What I needed was a way to flip through sites like photos.

The first idea I had seemed promising. I exported everything I had saved as a CSV. Then I used [INSERT CLI TOOL]() to convert it to JSON, which I modified slighly to instead export a JS object so it could be imported directly.
