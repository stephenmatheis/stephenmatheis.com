I use [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com) to save bookmarks. I rarely go back to look at the links I saved. I mostly just want to feel safe closing tabs.

I recently did want to look up a site I had saved. But I could only remember what it looked like. Instapaper, unsurprisingly, only lists a sites' title, description, address, and favicon. I didn't want to load them one at a time.

The first idea seemed promising. I exported everything I had saved as a CSV. Then I used [INSERT CLI TOOL]() to convert it to JSON, which I modified slighly to instead export a JS object so it could be imported directly.
